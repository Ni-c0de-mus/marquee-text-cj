      <h1>Fluid Vertical Rhythm</h1>
      <p>This is an example of fluid type that maintains vertical rhythm. I'll try and find the time to write it up in
        detail soon.</p>
      <p>If the lines seem to glitch out ocasionally it's not because the vertical rhythm is broken. I think it's
        because of the way the browser rounds. The height of the gradient background that draws the lines on the body
        element is only rounded once, whereas real line hight is rounded on a per element basis. This adds up by the
        time you get to the bottom of the page. No idea how to fix it!</p>

      <h1>Down the Rabbit Hole</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
        nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’

        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
        stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
        daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

      <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>

      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
        it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
        Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing
        before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was
        so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good
        or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
